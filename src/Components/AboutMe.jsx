      <p>
        Since graduating from Northcoders in March 2025, I have been looking for
        my first paid job as a Junior Developer. In the meantime, I have been
        working as an intern at Digital Edge (where I have been learning how to
        work in a commercial envrioment along side clients and other
        developers), working on my portfolio, and keeping my coding skills sharp
        as well as up-to-date.

  );
};
